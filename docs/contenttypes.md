>With flexfolio theme install you got a subfolder `config-examples` with example configuration files in your flexfolio folder. With quick install this examples are already active at the right place, in case of an expert install you will need to move this files to your Bolt CMS folder `app/config` and rename the files (remove `.~~example~~.` in the filename).
