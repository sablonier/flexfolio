### Settings

>There are two places where you have to edit the main settings: one is *Configuration->Main Configuration* where you set the site name, the other is *Einstellungen* where you have to create a new record to change i.e. fonts or footer text.


#### Site name
Go to your dashboard and choose *Configuration->Main Configuration*. Look out for 
```yaml
# The name of the website
	sitename: all-mine.org
	payoff: 
```

Change `all-mine.org` to your site name. *Save* the configuration. Click on *View site* on top of dashboard and have a look if the site name has changed accordingly.

#### Other settings
Go to your dashboard and click on *Settings*. Create a new set and start to change settings for **font**, base font **size**, **sort** on homepage, **footer text**. You can also set links here to your **social media accounts** which will appear below the footer (a simple button with first letter of the network name, without any logos). Save your changes and click on *View site* on top of dashboard to see your modifications.

#####Current available fonts
>Some basic well designed open source fonts are distributed with flexfolio. You will find 4 fonts in settings at the moment, 2 serif (Crimson, Avrile) and 2 sans serif (Rubik, Eliane). The flexfolio default font is **Rubik**. All fonts are under *SIL Open Font License* and are available on [fontlibrary.org](https://www.fontlibrary.org) collection. In case you want to use the fonts for other purpose please download the origin/distributed package from mentioned sites.
